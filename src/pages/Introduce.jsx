            <blockquote>I love seeing things through other objects.</blockquote>
            <p>
              Between time and seasons, between objects, between moments of
              love... everything has gaps. Even in emotions, gaps always exist.
              I love those gaps. Sometimes, various emotions are contained
              within those gapsâ€”longing, loneliness, affection. I want to
              capture and express them.
